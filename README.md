### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Runs the test for the app.

React chat app with user information stored and retrieved through Firebase, including a photo to show it in the profile and in the chat conversations.

React Router, useContext, useState, useEffect, CSS modules, Firebase storage, firestore, authentication... are some of the tools used in this app, which is currently under construction.

Firebase keys are not available in the project because they are environment variables, so if you wish to clone the app, you would need to get your own firebase config keys.
